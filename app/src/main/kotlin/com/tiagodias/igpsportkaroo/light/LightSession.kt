/**

 * OFF stays off: while we have the light off, its auto sleep is paused ([SleepPause]), since asleep it would wake
 * lit when moved. [sleepPause] is the saved state from a previous session (a restart, a reboot) and
 * [onSleepPauseChanged] saves each change; it runs outside the command lock and must not call back into the
 * session's commands. A save that throws is logged and tried again after the next command.
